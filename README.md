# MyNewUsedCar

This mobile web application makes it easy for used car owners to post their car for sale and for used car buyers to discover sales nearby and get in contact with the seller. The app uses Sencha Touch as the development framework. The vehicle data comes from the Edmunds API and the communication channel between buyers and sellers is through Twitter. Google Maps is also used to show the sales nearby.

**Note**: Still in development. The event event ends on Sunday, Sept 18th.
